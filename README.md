# Fundraiser Success Based on launch Dates and Goals

## Overview of Project

The data set in question regarded a large number of kick-starter campaigns and their respective fundraising data. 


### Purpose

With a multitude of categories and levels of funding, this project aimed to determine the success of projects based on their launch dates and funding goals.  


## Analysis and Challenges

The biggest issue with this analysis was the amount of irrelevant information provided. Most of the data was ignored and filtered through in order to obtain relevant information. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to study the outcomes of the launch dates, the data was separated based on the month, as well as the result of the project. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In order to study the outcomes based on the initial goals, the data was separated based on the range of the goal as well as the outcome of the project.

## Results

The results show that the summer months (May-Aug) are more successful, breaking triple digits of successful project in May and June. Although canceled projects are steady, it seems that January is a particularly poor choice to launch a project with 7 canceled as well as very poor success rates.

In terms of goals, projects with goals under a thousand dollars have the most successful projects as well as the highest rates of success. Project with large goals of over fifty thousand are not recommended as ten out of the twelve in the set have failed.

Although the data suggest that larger goals are more likely to fail, there are not enough examples of projects with goals above twenty-five thousand to make an accurate prediction.

It would be interesting to study the outcomes of projects based on the year they were created as well as the country they were in. The economy of these countries could affect the donation patterns of investors.
